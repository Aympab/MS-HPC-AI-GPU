# LBM mini project in C++ (CPU)

A minimal cmake based project skeleton for 2D LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method) simulation.

This C++ code has been adapted from the python code [lbmFlowAroundCylinder.py](https://github.com/sidsriv/Simulation-and-modelling-of-natural-processes/blob/master/lbmFlowAroundCylinder.py)

## about cmake

This template has been derived from [cuda-proj-tmpl](https://github.com/pkestene/cuda-proj-tmpl) so that it is ready for CUDA.

## How to build ?

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
# then you can run the application
./src/lbm
```
